# Project WIP
This is a WIP project that will be used for experimentation on hosting online and creating online web and game services.
This might be a permanent WIP but we will have to see.

Current phase - Relearning C# cus i completely forgot how to use it -_-

Phase 2 - Make front end of the website

Phase 3 - Host the front end part of the website

Also tempted to make a rhythem game down the line at some point stay tuned for that will be after ive decided ive messed with this enough.
